# Product-Pricing-Analysis-and-Recommendation-Systems

This repository presents an end-to-end data science solution to analyze and improve e-commerce product pricing and customer engagement using cleaned Amazon and Shopee datasets. It employs advanced statistical modeling techniques like Gaussian GLM and Two-way ANOVA to uncover meaningful relationships between product ratings, categories, and discount patterns, providing actionable insights for pricing and promotional strategies.

Additionally, the project develops a hybrid sentiment classifier combining VADER and an SVM with TF-IDF features, achieving 94% accuracy in classifying customer reviews. These sentiment insights are integrated into both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering recommendation systems, enabling personalized and relevant product suggestions that enhance the overall customer shopping experience.
